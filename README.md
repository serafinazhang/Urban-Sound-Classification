# Urban Sound Classification with Neural Networks

Junqian Zhang

**Abstract:**
The aim of this project is to explore whether neural network can work on urban sound classification. It experiments on three neural network architectures: Convolution Neural Network, Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network and Parallel Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network, with three audio feature extraction methods: spectrogram, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, and chromagram, to see how different combinations of architecture of neural network and feature influence the classification performances.

**Key Words**:
Sound Classification, Image Classification, Convolution Neural Network, Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network, Parallel Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network
